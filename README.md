### Hi there 👋, my name is Patrick (👨🏻 he/him)


I'm a front end engineer currently working at [@ebay](https://www.ebay.com)!

I’ve been in the industry over 10 years and love what I do. I frequently enjoy building new side projects and learning new tools and languages! 

Outside of work, I’ve been incredibly busy with my main side project, Fish Harmony (check it out on the App Store), a saltwater fish comparison tool to make sure your fish get along and don’t hurt or kill each other!

I also have another not-yet-launched project Called Retro Hockey! It's a throwback game I've been working on using ~SwiftUI and Spritekit~ Godot 4! Details on that coming soon.

You can usually find me coding, tending to my aquariums or binge watching the latest Netflix series with my wife and cat.

I also am available for hire! Please send me an email if you are interested in web development or mobile application freelancing.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out on Twitter [@pcanella](https://twitter.com/pcanella) or shoot me an email patrickcanella at gmail dot com.

Thanks for reading!
